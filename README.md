# MixLang concept
A imaginary programming language aiming at simplicity and strong type hinting, I'd like to make at some point.

It has *Mix* in the name because it's a mixture of multiple languages.
Specifically I want to combine:
- Type and class system of **Java**
- Simplicity and threading of **Lua**
- Utilities of **GDScript**

into a 1 perfect language with my extra additions.
